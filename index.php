            When people say <i>"If you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear"</i> <br>

            I want to response <i>"I need privacy, not because my actions are questionable, but because your judgement and intentions are."</i>

            <p class="introduct"><i>[...] But saying that you don't need or want privacy because you have nothing to hide is to assume that no one should have, or could have, to hide anything -- including their immigration status, unemployment history, financial history, and health records. 
                You're assuming that no one, including yourself, might object to revealing to anyone information about their religious beliefs, political affiliations, and sexual activities, as casually as some choose to reveal their movie and music tastes and reading preferences.</i></p>

            <p class="introduct"><i>Privacy is not a luxury : it is a right – one that we need to defend in the digital realm as much as in the physical realm. We need to stay vigilant to maintain access to that right, though ... especially as technology continues to advance...</i></p>
